# Pacmen-Exercise
## Pacmen 
The pacmen exercise was alot of fun! Learning how to maneuver the pacmen character to chomp in different directions across the screen, learning how to navigate and how far across the page and which direction.
In the Pacman exercise, I move Pacman across the screen using two images: one with his mouth open and one with it closed. When Pacman reaches a page boundary, he reverses his direction, requiring two additional images of Pacman facing the opposite way. This exercise taught me how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) by changing the position and image source of an HTML image element. By programming Pacman to automatically move and switch images, I learned how to screen coordinates and image positioning. Ultimately, this exercise provides a basic introduction to controlling webpage elements using JavaScript.

Future Improvements would be to learn how to make the pacmen move diaganally and timing out the mouth bites better.
